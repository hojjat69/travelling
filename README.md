In this repository I provide back-end codes including Django as well as HTML, CSS and JS files with images to create front-end of the web. This website is developed for Travel Agencies. It is able of dynamic visualization in the destinations part. Moreover, the back-end of the website allows you to manage the users as well as destinations their prices and even images! The next phase of the project is to create web platform whereby users can log in and make an order!
